"""How the MobileNetV2 model works is that we pass it an image and then it breaks
the image down in arrays of numbers and then each number is a percentage of how close
it is to a certain object. Then after it gets decoded by the decoder so that its not 
a bunch of numbers but actual words that we can understand. And then it grabs the 
first response with the top 3."""
